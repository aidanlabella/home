    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicolor_cat" target="_blank">bicolor cat</a> is a cat with white fur combined with fur of some other colour, for example solid black, tabby, or colourpointed.

  <p>I am currently working towards my Ph.D. at Brown University in the <a href="https://cs.brown.edu" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Department of Computer Science</a> where I am advised by <a href="https://cs.brown.edu/people/sbach" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Stephen Bach</a> in the BATS research group and AI ‘superlab’. I am primarily interested in developing novel solutions for mining and learning from large, real-world datasets while also exploiting new methods for harvesting and labeling data. Lately, I have been interested in solutions for datasets in the scientific domain.</p>
  <p>My current research has been largely in collaboration with <a href="https://sites.brown.edu/poberlab/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Dr. Jonathan Pober</a> at Brown’s <a href="https://www.brown.edu/academics/physics/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Department of Physics</a> on SWIFT - Spectrum and Wireless Innovation enabled by Future Technologies. SWIFT is an NSF-funded effort to develop machine learning applications for the detection and removal of radio frequency interference (RFI) from 21cm cosmology data. The challenge presented by this task is the sheer volume of unlabeled data that is produced by the data sources (telescopes), prompting the introduction of weak supervision to harvest RFI detection rules that produce meaningful training datasets for anomaly detection models.</p>
  <p>Before starting my graduate studies at Brown, I graduated with my B.Sc. in Computer Science from RIT. I was advised by and worked on data science and machine learning applications to general aviation flight data, particularly for the FAA-funded National General Aviation Flight Information Database (<a href="https://ngafid.org" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">NGAFID</a>)</p>
